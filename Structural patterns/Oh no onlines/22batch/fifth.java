/*
ZBazar traditionally offers three fixed Ramadan packages every year. They are: Standard, Special, and Premium.
 
These packages have predefined contents and pricing, and over time, they have become very popular. Many customers not only purchase them for personal use but also send them as gifts to friends and relatives during Ramadan. The structure and pricing of these Ramadan packages well-established and are part of   ZBazar's seasonal business model.

However, recently, ZBazar has received requests for slight customization. Some customers want to add fruit, others want to include sweets, and others want to opt for premium gift packaging when sending a package to loved ones.
Instead of allowing full customization, ZBazar decided to provide limited flexibility by allowing customers to optionally add:
(l) a predefined Fruit Package,
(2) a predefined Sweet Package, and 
(3) premium gift packaging for presentation purposes. 
These enhancements may be applied in any combination. 
[The fruit and sweet packages are sold throughout the whole year and
are also part of ZBazar's business model.]
Your task is to make the existing system capable ofhandling this Ramadan's special flexibility without
modifying the existing packages. You can safely assume that the system already supports the previous
business model. The system must correctly calculate the final price and description of the customized
bundle while preserving the original package structure
